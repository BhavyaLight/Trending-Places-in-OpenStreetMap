<p>Trending places aka OSM place trends, inspired by Google Trends, is an analysis of the
 <a href="http://planet.openstreetmap.org/tile_logs/">views on the OSM tiles</a> which could help us determine the trends in views of these places i.e. which places are gaining popularity due a hike in views and try to link them with
  the latest news around that region.
</p>
<h3>What is a Trending Place?</h3>
<p>Places that have unusually higher views than their normal views, implying that places like tourist hot spots are not trending unless there is an increase in the number of views from the average.
</p>
<h3>How significant is a trend?</h3>
<p>Once the 'trending' places or the places with a significant relative hike in views are determined,
  they need to be ranked relative to each other as well.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>To get the top 10 trending places world wide, the significance is determined as a parameter of the world population-the more number of people looking at it, the more significant the trend is.</li>
  <p></p>
  <p>Say for two places <i>TouristyPlace_A, UnseenVillage_B</i> the relative hike in views from average is 20%. However, 20% of the <i>TouristyPlace_A</i> is about 500 views, while that of an <i>UnseenVillage_B</i> is 20 people. Thus, the trend is TouristyPlace_A will be considered more significant and ranked higher than UnseenVillage_B.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
          <ul>
          <li><h4>Crawling activity on osm</h4></li>
          <p>The open source nature of OSM, as well as development with OSM leads to several crawling
          activities on OSM which are highlighted in the image below. The lack of availability of I.P Address
          to track these artifacts makes it difficult to filter them out and they often hamper the results.
          Certain artifacts like the curve trail over Russia on the upper right hand side is a periodic crawling
          phenomenon. </p>

<p align="center"><i>Fig. January, 2016 All places with views. Major Discrepancies highlighted</i></p>
          <li><h4>Clustering around a trending place</h4></li>
          <p> While filtering out top n trending places, often the n places that appear are quite close
          to each other. An example can be seen in the image below. This phenomenon is expected because
          users tend to view an several tiles close by while viewing a particular place. A small algorithm to
          detect these clusters and reserve only the highest viewed place amongst the top trending was added
          in the code and this issue was resolved.</p>

              <p align="center"><i>Fig. January 31st 2016, Graph of total views vs. date of top 10 trending places.
              The similar structure of the graphs suggest that the places are a cluster and have been viewed together.</i></p
          <li><h4>Ranking the importance of trending places</h4></li>
          <p> A T-score is calculated for the total views over n days (By default and the minimum required is 7 days).
              Hikes in places are detected based on the T-score which in broad terms is the number of standard deviations
              the views on a particular day are away from the mean. After analysis and testing of the OSM data, a cut off T-score
              of 3.5 was  decided. However, on fetched top 'x' places with the highest T-score implying highest deviation from
              mean often resulted in displaying insignificant peaks as can be compared in Fig. A and Fig B. below.</p>
              <img src="images\Unusual_spike.jpg" alt="Preview not available.", align="center">
              <p align="center"><i>Fig A. January 31st 2016, Graph of total views vs. date of lat, lon: -84.79, -140.58 in Antarctica.
              with the T-score pointed out. It can be seen that the place has almost 0 views usually, but a small spike of
              nearly 75 views gives it a very high Tscore of nearly 6. The question is, how important is the trend for this place
              versus another place with regular views?</i></p>
              <img src="images\Normal_spike.jpg" alt="Preview not available.", align="middle">
              <p align="center"><i>Fig B. January 31st 2016, Graph of total views vs. date of lat, lon: -84.79, 1.3623.58 in Antarctica.
              with the T-score pointed out. The place has regular views and a T-score of 5.77 when the deviation from the average
              views is nearly 1000. Compared to the place in Fig A. Should this have a higher trend?</i></p>
              <p> A scatter plot for absolute deviation in views and T-score suggested the threshold level for abs increase.
              Further, the ranking was decided in the following manner. An absolute increase in views of all places was calculated.
              The worldwide median of these absolute views was calculated and the trending places were ranked based on the relative increase in absolute views of the places
              over the world wide median. A median was chosen instead of mean because median get less effected by outliers or peaks.
              The logic behind this ranking is that the importance 'trending places' worldwide is a parameter of the world human population
              looking at OSM maps. Over time, as more and more people use OSM, the absolute increase in views of all places in OSM will increase.
              The places that have a greater increase than the usual (median in our case) will have a more significant trend.</p>
              </ul>
<h3>Example of Positive Result</h3>
          <p>Fort McMurray, Canada was a <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/fort-mcmurray-fire-now-too-large-too-fierce-to-stop-without-rain">victim of wildfire </a> in the beginning of May 2016.
          It appeared on the Trending places on 4th May, 2016.</p>
            <img src="images\Fort_McMurray_result.PNG" alt="Preview not available.", align="middle">
           <p align="center"><i>Fig. shows the Twitte bot tweet on 4th May, 2016 with the attached graph for the Top 10 trending places
           and the status text. Due to a limit on the length of tweet the names of all Trending places are not tweeted
           and Ellipsis is appended after the word limit is reached. However, all names can be seen on the graph.
           Places with names in non english characters are replace with the lat and lon values and country code.</i></p>

<h3>More about the code</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>Currently, the code fetches data for past 7 days(default). This value can be changed to
          'n' days for a greater sample accuracy. Top 10 trending places are stored by default. Even this value can be changed
          to store more than 10 places.</li>
          <li>The code 'Top_trending.py' can also provide output for trending places over a range of dates at once. However,
          sufficient data should be fetched from Fetch2.py depending on your period and your range of dates.
          For example to get all trending places from 4th May, 2016 to 7th May, 2016, the data must be fetched from
          28th May, 2016 up to 7th May, 2016 (for a 7 day oeriod). It can then find the top trending places and graphs at once.</li>
